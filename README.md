# React with Construct 3 - Example

This is an example plugin to render UI with React in Construct 3.

# How to run

To build it as a c3addon:

`npm run build` 

To run as a development c3addon:

`npm run dev`

# How to make it really useful

As per my opinion, always reloading Construct to see the changes in the React layer is a huge waste of time. Thus I would recommend to either use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), or `index.html` that mocks the ui, or both to develop the UI without Construct.
